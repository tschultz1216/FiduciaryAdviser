# FiduciaryAdviser
Implementation of Bridge design pattern in Java to simulate a Fiduciary Adviser for Investments

This was a group project implemented by Deborah Lawrence, Leng Muy Ghuy, and myself. We have written a software system that will simulate
the process of finacial advising. This system can be used to evalue current investment strategies, forecast future strategies, and as a 
general investment calculator.
